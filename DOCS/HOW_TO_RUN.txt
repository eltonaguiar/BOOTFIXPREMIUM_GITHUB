                         STEP-BY-STEP GUIDE
================================================================================

SITUATION:
  You tried to run MiracleBoot.ps1 but got an error about needing
  Administrator privileges. This is NORMAL and EXPECTED.

  *** MiracleBoot REQUIRES Administrator privileges ***
  *** This is NOT a bug - it's a security requirement ***

================================================================================
                      THE EASIEST WAY TO RUN IT
================================================================================

METHOD 1: Use the Batch Launcher (RECOMMENDED)

  Location: c:\Users\zerou\Downloads\MiracleBoot_v7_1_1 - Github code\

    6. Click "YES"
    7. MiracleBoot will launch with admin privileges
    8. Output will be saved to a log file with timestamp

  This is the BEST method because:
    ✓ One-click launch
    ✓ Automatic UAC handling
    ✓ Automatic logging
    ✓ No typing required

    powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File "MiracleBoot.ps1" 2>&1 | Tee-Object -FilePath "MIRACLEBOOT_RUN_$(Get-Date -Format 'yyyyMMdd_HHmmss').log"

    4. Press Enter
    5. MiracleBoot will launch

  Cons: More complex, requires typing

================================================================================
                  WHAT YOU'LL SEE WHEN IT RUNS
================================================================================

First:
  - A UAC prompt asking "Do you want to allow this app to make changes?"
  - Click: YES

Then:
  - Text showing environment detection
  - Messages about checking capabilities
  - The GUI interface will open (or TUI if GUI unavailable)

The GUI will show tabs for:
  ✓ Summary - System health status
  ✓ Boot - BCD and boot configuration
  ✓ Repair - Boot repair tools
  ✓ Diagnostics - Event logs and system analysis
  ✓ Network - Network adapter diagnostics
  ✓ Drivers - Driver injection utilities
  ✓ Slow PC - Performance analysis
  ✓ And more...

================================================================================
                    IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG
================================================================================

Problem: "Administrator Privileges Required"
  → You're not running as Admin
  → Use Method 1 (RUN_MIRACLEBOOT_ADMIN.bat) OR
  → Right-click and select "Run as Administrator"

Problem: PowerShell says "not recognized"
  → This shouldn't happen on Windows 10/11
  → Try Method 2: Right-click the .ps1 file

Problem: GUI doesn't appear
  → Don't worry - it will use the Text UI instead
  → This is normal and expected on some systems
  → All features are still available

Problem: Access Denied / Can't repair
  → You might need to restart Windows
  → Some repairs require a restart to complete
  → Follow the on-screen instructions

For detailed debugging:
  → Read TEST_SIMPLE_LOAD_OUTPUT.log
  → Read MIRACLEBOOT_STATUS_REPORT.md
  → Read MIRACLEBOOT_DEVELOPMENT_CONTINUATION_REPORT.md
